# Seaborn.3.Pairplot
The pairplot function in Seaborn is a great way to visualize relationships between multiple variables in a dataset. It creates a matrix of scatterplots for each pair of variables, along with optional histograms or Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) plots on the diagonal to show the distribution of each variable.\ 
The pairplot plots all pairwise combinations of numerical features in the dataset, helping to visualize potential correlations or trends. The diagonal typically shows univariate distributions for each variable (such as histograms or KDEs).
